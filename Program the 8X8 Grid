Practical 5 )GPIO: LED Grid Module: Program the 8X8 Grid with Different Formulas
To program an 8x8 LED grid module with different formulas, you will need a microcontroller with 
GPIO pins and a compatible LED matrix module. Here's a sample program in Python using the 
Raspberry Pi and the Adafruit LED matrix module to display different patterns on the LED grid using 
various formulas:
import time
import numpy as np
from adafruit_ht16k33.matrix import Matrix8x8
# Initialize LED matrix
matrix = Matrix8x8()
# Define various formulas
formulas = [
 lambda x, y: np.sin(x/8)*np.cos(y/8),
 lambda x, y: np.sin(np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)/8),
 lambda x, y: np.sin(x/8)*np.sin(y/8),
 lambda x, y: np.sin(x/8)**2 + np.cos(y/8)**2,
 lambda x, y: np.sin(np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)/8)**2,
 lambda x, y: np.sin(x/4)**2 + np.cos(y/4)**2
]
# Loop through each formula
for formula in formulas:
 # Loop through each LED on the matrix
 for x in range(8):
 for y in range(8):
 # Calculate the brightness based on the formula
 brightness = int((formula(x, y) + 1) * 8)
 if brightness > 8:
 brightness = 8
 elif brightness < 0:
 brightness = 0
 # Set the LED brightness on the matrix
 matrix[x, y] = brightness
 # Display the matrix for 5 seconds
 matrix.show()
 time.sleep(5)
This program will display 6 different patterns on the LED grid, each generated by a different 
formula. The formulas are defined as lambda functions that take x and y coordinates as input and 
output a brightness value between 0 and 1. The brightness values are then mapped to a range of 
0 to 8 to set the LED brightness on the matrix. The program loops through each LED on the 
matrix and calculates its brightness based on the current formula. It then sets the LED brightness 
on the matrix and displays it for 5 seconds before moving on to the next formula.
Note that this is just a sample program and may need to be modified depending on the specific 
LED matrix module and microcontroller being used. You should refer to the datasheet and 
documentation of your module and microcontroller for more information on how to program 
and control them.
