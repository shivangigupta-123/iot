Practical 4 )SPI: Camera Connection and capturing Images/Videos using SPI
Hardware Required:
• Camera module with SPI interface
• Microcontroller with SPI interface (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino with SPI shield)
• Breadboard
• Jumper wires
Steps:
1) Identify the camera module's SPI pins. These usually include SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS.
2) Identify the microcontroller's SPI pins. These usually include SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS. 
Refer to the datasheet or pinout diagram of your microcontroller for more information.
3) Connect the SPI pins of the camera module to the corresponding SPI pins of the 
microcontroller using jumper wires. Make sure to connect the CS pin of the camera module 
to a GPIO pin of the microcontroller that can be used as a chip select.
4) Power up both the camera module and the microcontroller.
5) Initialize the SPI communication in the microcontroller using the appropriate library or code. 
In Python, you can use the spidev library for this purpose.
6) Send the appropriate commands to the camera module using SPI to initialize it and configure 
its settings. Refer to the camera module's datasheet for more information on the commands 
and settings.
7) Continuously read data from the camera module using SPI and store it in a buffer or file in 
the microcontroller's memory.
8) Once enough data has been read, process it to obtain an image or video file. Refer to the 
camera module's datasheet for more information on the data format and processing 
methods.
9) Here's some sample code in Python using spidev library to capture images from a camera 
module using SPI interface:
import spidev
import time
# Initialize SPI
spi = spidev.SpiDev()
spi.open(0, 0)
spi.max_speed_hz = 1000000
# Initialize camera
spi.writebytes([0x01, 0x00]) # Enable camera
spi.writebytes([0x02, 0x00]) # Set image resolution
spi.writebytes([0x03, 0x01]) # Set image quality
# Capture image
spi.writebytes([0x04, 0x00]) # Start capture
time.sleep(1) # Wait for capture to complete
image = []
for i in range(0, 1024):
 data = spi.readbytes(1)
 image.append(data[0])
# Save image to file
with open('image.raw', 'wb') as f:
 f.write(bytes(image))
Note that this is just a sample code and may not work with all camera modules. You should refer to 
the datasheet of your camera module and microc
