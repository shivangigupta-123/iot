Practical 2 )Demonstrate Arduino Uno and its pins interfacing with IDE
1.Connect your Arduino Uno board to your computer using a USB cable.
2.Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3.Go to Tools > Board and select "Arduino Uno" from the list of available boards.
4.Go to Tools > Port and select the serial port to which your Arduino Uno is connected. If you're 
not sure which port to choose, you can try each port until you find the correct one.
5.In the Arduino IDE, create a new sketch by going to File > New.
6.Write the following code in the sketch:
void setup() {
 // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
 pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
7.Go to Sketch > Upload to upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno.
8.After uploading, the onboard LED on the Arduino Uno should start flashing on and off.
In this example, we are using the onboard LED of the Arduino Uno which is connected to digital 
pin 13 (also known as LED_BUILTIN). We set the pinMode to OUTPUT in the setup function to 
tell the Arduino that we will be sending a signal to this pin. In the loop function, we turn the LED 
on and off using the digitalWrite function, and then use the delay function to wait for a second 
before repeating the process.
Note: Make sure to select the correct board and port before uploading your sketch, otherwise it 
may fail to upload or not work as expected.
