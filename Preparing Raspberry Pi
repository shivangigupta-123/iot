Practical 1 )Preparing Raspberry Pi: Hardware preparation and Installation
Installation
To prepare your Raspberry Pi for use, you will need to follow a few steps:
Hardware Preparation:
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source using a micro USB cable.
2. Connect a keyboard and mouse to your Raspberry Pi using USB ports.
3. Connect a monitor to your Raspberry Pi using an HDMI cable.
4. Insert a microSD card with the Raspberry Pi operating system image into the microSD 
card slot on the Raspberry Pi.
Installation:
1. Download the Raspberry Pi operating system image from the official Raspberry Pi 
website. You can choose from several different operating systems, including Raspberry Pi 
OS and Ubuntu.
2. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager software on your computer. This software 
allows you to write the operating system image to the microSD card.
3. Launch the Raspberry Pi Imager software and select the operating system image you 
downloaded in Step 1.
4. Select the microSD card you inserted into your Raspberry Pi in the Hardware Preparation 
steps.
5. Click the "Write" button to write the operating system image to the microSD card.
6. Once the image has been written to the microSD card, eject the microSD card from your 
computer and insert it into the microSD card slot on your Raspberry Pi.
7. Power on your Raspberry Pi by plugging it in to a power source.
8. The first time you boot up your Raspberry Pi, it will take a few minutes to install the 
operating system and configure the device. Once the installation process is complete, you 
will be prompted to set up your Raspberry Pi by creating a user account and configuring 
network settings.
9. Follow the prompts to complete the setup process, and your Raspberry Pi will be ready to 
use!
Note: Make sure to properly shut down your Raspberry Pi by selecting "Shutdown" from the 
menu before unplugging the device from the power source to prevent data loss and damage to 
the device
